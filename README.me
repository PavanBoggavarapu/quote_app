# InspireMe: Quote of the Day Generator (Flask Web App)

## 🎯 Project Overview
Develop a Flask-based web application titled **"InspireMe: Quote of the Day Generator"**, which dynamically displays a new inspirational quote each time the page is refreshed or when the user clicks the **"Get New Quote"** button.

The system stores a predefined list of motivational quotes within the Flask backend and uses **Jinja2 templating** to render them dynamically on the frontend.

Users can also contribute their own quotes through a **Bootstrap modal form**, which are temporarily stored in memory and displayed as part of the rotating list.

## 🧩 Features
- Displays a random quote on each page load.
- **"Get New Quote"** button fetches new quotes instantly using AJAX.
- Modal popup for users to submit their own quotes.
- Confirmation page after quote submission.
- Clean, responsive UI built with Bootstrap and minimal CSS.

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **User visits** the homepage (`/`)  
   → Flask picks a random quote from the list and displays it.  
2. **User clicks** “Get New Quote”  
   → JavaScript sends AJAX request to `/new_quote` → returns a new random quote dynamically.  
3. **User submits** a new quote via modal form  
   → Data is sent to `/submit` route → added to the in-memory list.  
4. **User redirected** to `/success`  
   → Displays “Quote submitted successfully” message.
